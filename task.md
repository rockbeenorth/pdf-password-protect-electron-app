i need an app for miscrosoft windows 11

- admin team has to archive and password-protect pdf files for patients
- this is very annoying
- and date of birth is always on the same spot
- so i guess i want a dropzone wher ethey will put a pdf, a cv2 or something similar will read a doc, extract DOB (09/03/1983 or 9/3/1983, dd / mm / yyyy), transform it into a password (09081983, always with zeroes if necessary, 8 digits) and return a password-protected pdf
- the best option is to end not only with a protected document but also a report with a screenshot of DOB and a password so that they can review and edit if necessary


i don't have windows here (i am running on a mac) but i have a computer i can start to test a build. can we build it ... on a mac os? via CLI only? Pretty please? :)))
